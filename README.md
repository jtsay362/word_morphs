# Word Morphs

Uses [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) and
[pattern-en](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern-en) to generate the morphs
for all words in [WordNet](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/).

Outputs a JSON file that maps words to all morphs. Does not include the morphs in
WordNet unless they can be generated by pattern-en.

Requires Python 2.7 (pattern-en does not yet support Python 3). To run:

```
python main.py
```

Used by [Solve for All](https://solveforall.com/), an ad-free, customizable, and
hackable search engine.
